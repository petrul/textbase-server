/**
 * Checked once, right after the app is fully up: does Milvus have the
 * collection this run needs and respond to it? Flips off vector similarity
 * search for the rest of this run if not, instead of every subsequent
 * search request failing with a raw gRPC exception.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT also ping the embedder: textbase-server itself
 * essentially never embeds text at request time (that's batch work,
 * delegated to textbase-nestjs) - the only embedder call left on this
 * request path is none at all, so pinging Ollama here would just be an
 * unrelated dependency this check doesn't need, and one more thing that
 * can make startup slow/flaky if Ollama happens to be busy/contended.
 *
 * A likely reason this matters in practice: swapping the production
 * embedder (see VectorConfig) means the Milvus collection it expects
 * (named after that embedder, by convention) may not exist yet until
 * someone re-embeds the corpus with the new model - this lets the rest of
 * the app (DB-backed search, everything not vector-search-related) keep
 * working normally in the meantime instead of the whole app failing to
 * start or every /api/search/milvus and /api/search/ann call blowing up.
 *
 * This is a one-shot startup check, not a continuous health monitor - a
 * recovery (e.g. the collection gets created later) needs a restart to be
 * picked up.
